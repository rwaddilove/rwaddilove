- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rwaddilove
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming Mac and PC as a hobby. Mostly Java, but some Python.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm at most places as rwaddilove, like Gmail, Hotmail, and more.
- âš¡ If you're really old, you may remember me from computer magazines like Electron User, Atari ST User, PC Today, PC Home, iCreate, Web User, and more.
- âš¡ Fun fact: That photo of me was taken 28 years ago.
