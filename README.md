- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rwaddilove
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (just as a hobby)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm everywhere as rwaddilove, like
     Gmail, Outlook, Proton Mail, Twitter, Mastodon, Facebook etc.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Long ago I worked on computer magazines, like
    Electron User, Atari ST User, PC Today, PC Home, iCreate,
    Web User, and more. Sadly, they are all gone. No-one buys
    computer magazines anymore, we use the internet instead.
