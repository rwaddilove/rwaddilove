- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rwaddilove
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (just as a hobby)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm everywhere as rwaddilove, like Gmail, Outlook, and many more places
- âš¡ Fun fact: Long ago I wrote for or worked on computer magazines, like Electron User, Atari ST User, PC Today, PC Home, iCreate, Web User, and several more. Sadly, they are all gone.
